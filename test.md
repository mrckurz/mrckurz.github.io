The technological environment that surrounds us nowadays - evolved by the invisible integration of digital artifacts into everyday objects - is equipped with mobile and inter- connected technology delivering sensor data characterizing our current activities and more generally the context. For example, today’s smart phones can be regarded as multi-sensor platforms delivering high quality multi-modal environmental data. This aspect reverses the traditional approach of human activity recognition, since the artifi- cial and obtrusive deployment of sensors in the environment, on objects, or on people’s bodies can be regarded as obsolete. This thesis presents a novel approach for recogniz- ing the activities (and more generally the context) of individuals, by taking advantage of currently available sensor devices in an opportunistic way, without the effort of initial sensor definition and deployment. Thus, the sensing infrastructure in an opportunistic system cannot be defined and fixed before operation, which brings about a novel and innovative scientific area with challenging aspects that compose the research conducted in this thesis: (i) utilization of spontaneously available heterogeneous sensors without prior knowledge of the physical, working, and deployment characteristics and (ii) the handling of a spontaneous and dynamic sensing infrastructure.

The contributions of this thesis are both relating to (i) novel methods and algorithmic solutions for opportunistic activity recognition and to (ii) the design and implementa- tion of a system that integrates all developed approaches in a runnable environment that is used for comprehensive evaluations. The methodological focus to overcome the issue of opportunistic activity recognition is on (i) the common utilization of sponta- neously available heterogeneous sensors (even of immaterial sources of information, for example web-services), (ii) the definition of a semantic markup approach in form of sensor self-descriptions allowing the dynamic configuration of the Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) of sensors and the persistent memorization of recognition capabilities, and on (iii) the algorithmic baseline for enabling the definition and configuration of co- operative sensor ensembles according to the specific activities of interest. All proposed methods - together with the developed system - can be regarded as step towards the vision of recognizing human activities in an opportunistic way.
